    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p> I am a junior at Marywood University, dual majoring in Computer Science and Information Security.<br>
    I am proud to say that I am also a student athlete here at Marywood University, I've been a part of the<br>
    Mens basketball team Team since I've started here. Aside from that, I work in the IT department as a work-study.</p>

    <h2>My Hobbies & interests</h2>

    <p>I like to spend my time messing with either computers or anything that has a motor of some sort.<br>
         Off the top of my head, my top projects are, an almost running and driving, clean, 2000 Audi TT,<br>
          PCBs of all sorts to pair with my flipper device or work as standalones, and then trying to learn<br>
           how to create, maintain, and train AIs.</p>
